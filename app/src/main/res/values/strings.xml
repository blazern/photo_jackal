    <string name="onboarding2_descr">The whole purpose of this tiny app is to degrade quality of your photos, so that they would take less space (doesn\'t matter, if they would start looking horrible)</string>

    <string name="onboarding3_title">Why does the app look so unpolished?</string>
    <string name="onboarding3_descr">Because I didn\'t polish it! I made it in one weekend for personal use, but then thought that maybe someone else would also find it handy</string>
